# python-api-challenge
"What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"
Background
Data's true power is its ability to definitively answer questions. So, let's take what you've learned about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that?

Before You Begin
Create a new repository for this project called python-api-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Inside your local Git repository, create a directory for this assignment. Use a folder name that corresponds to the Challenges, such as WeatherPy.

Inside the folder you just created, add the files called WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb that you will find in the starter code ZIP file provided. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

Push your changes to GitHub.

Add a .gitignore File
For this assignment, you will need to add a .gitignore file to your repo. Doing so will prevent the api_keys.py file that contains your API key from being shared with the public. If you skip this step, anyone using GitHub could copy and use your API key, and you may incur charges as a result.

To get stsrted, type git status in the command line to see a list of all the untracked files that you have created so far.

To add only the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub, type git add WeatherPy.ipynb. Keep in mind that you would have to add each file individually when adding or updating a file. A more efficient solution is to add all of the files that you don't want to track to the .gitignore file.

Before adding your files to GitHub, add api_keys.py to the .gitignore file by following these steps:

Open your python-api-challenge GitHub folder in VS Code.

Open the .gitignore file and type the following code on the first line:

# Adding config.py file.
api_keys.py
In the command line, type git status and press Enter. The output should indicate that the .gitignore file has been modified and the WeatherPy.ipynb file is untracked.

Use git add, git commit, and git push to commit the modifications to .gitignore and the WeatherPy.ipynb file to GitHub.

On GitHub, the only new file you should find is the WeatherPy.ipynb file.

Instructions
This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

For this part, you'll use the WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. The starter code will guide you through the process of using your Python coding skills to develop a solution to address the required functionalities.

To get started, the code required to generate random geographic coordinates and the nearest city to each latitude and longitude combination is provided.

Requirement 1: Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
To fulfill the second requirement, compute the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). You may find it helpful to define a function in order to create the linear regression plots.

Next, create a series of scatter plots. Be sure to include the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values as you can see in the following image
